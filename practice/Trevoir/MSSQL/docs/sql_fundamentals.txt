Renaming Columns in queries. AS keyword
We use AS clause to rename a column using double quotation""
example:  SELECT emp_no AS "Employee ID"
          FROM employees;

Column Concatenation
 Concatenation is when we combine two columns data into one new column.
 Example: 
     SELECT    first_name,
               last_name,
               CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS "Full Name"
               FROM employees;

What is a function? A functions is something that takes in an input, and
generates an output. For example, the function CONCAT() took first_name 
and last_name as input parameters, and generated "Full Name" column as an 
output.
So a function, is a set of steps that creates a single value.

Aggregate function
     Aggregate functions aggregate data, and produce a single value.
     Like aggregating all salaries column into a new column with total 
     salaries.
     Aggregate functions operate on many records to produce one value
     producing a summary.

     SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG(), and COUNT() are all examples of aggregate
     functions.

Scalar function
     Scalar functions run against each individual row of data. Example 
     is CONCAT() function, where it ran against each first_name row and
     last_name row .
     Scalar function operate on each record independently producing multiple
     outputs.
