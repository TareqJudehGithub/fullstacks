Normalization
 - The process of removing  INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE *anomalies from data
   tables.
 - This process leads to multiple tables that have relationships.

 - Normalization has 4 main stages
  - First Normal Form  (1NF)
  - Second Normal Form (2NF)
  - Third Normal Form  (3NF)
  - Boyce Cod Normal Form (BCNF)
    - More tables are introduced
    - All tables have Primary Keys (PK)
    - No redundancy in tables.
        - We create reference between tables with a relationship.
        - We establish dependencies between tables
    - We have achieved Referential integrity
    - We have removed all *anomalies.   



  - A database anomaly is an inconsistency or error that occurs in a database 
    due to poor design. 
  - Database anomaly can lead to issues like data redundancy, incorrect 
    information, or data loss.
