Tables
 - A database consists of one or more tables. Each Table
   is made up of rows and columns.
 - Each table contains rows and columns. A table is a particular area 
   for storing objects (en entity).
 - An entity is another name of a table.
 - Rows and records containing data points on an object.
 - Columns contain data points (text, numbers, dates, etc..)
 - Each row or record should be uniquely identified using a Primary
   Key (PK).
 - PK is a unique value.
 - a PK should never repeat.
 - Every table should have a PK.
 - In SQL Server, we use IDENTITY to automatically generate a PK values.
 - Indexes (aka foreign keys FK) are other unique values that a record can have.
 - They increase data lookup speed, but can reduce insert speed.
