Using CAST() or CONVERT() to a specific DECIMAL or NUMERIC type:
This is the most common and recommended approach for precise control over decimal places. You can cast the result of AVG() to a DECIMAL(precision, scale) or NUMERIC(precision, scale) data type, where precision is the total number of digits and scale is the number of digits after the decimal point.
Code

SELECT CAST(AVG(YourColumn) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS AverageValue
FROM YourTable;
